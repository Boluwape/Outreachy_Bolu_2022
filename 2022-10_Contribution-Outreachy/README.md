## Introduction

**```About:```** <br>
>Cross-River State is located in Nigeria's South South geopolitical zone. It’s capital is Calabar, and it shares borders with Benue State to the north, Ebonyi State and Abia State to the west, Akwa Ibom State to the southwest, and Cameroon to the east. >Cross-River State was formerly known as the South-Eastern State before being renamed in 1976. <br><br>
>Cross-River is the 19th largest in area and the 27th most populous state in Nigeria, with a population of over 3.8 million (as of 2016) and a land mass of approximately 21,265 km2. Currently, the state contains approximately 31% of Nigeria's total remaining tropical high forests.<br><br>
>Cross-River State currently has roughly 40% of Nigeria's remaining threatened Tropical Rainforests. These forests are one of the oldest rainforests in Africa, and the country's Largest remaining stand of comparably unlogged Tropical Rainforest. Cross-River state is also well-known for its ecotourism potential. The ecotourism industry is largely dependent on the Tropical Rainforest, which are home to species endemic to Cross-River State. <br><br>
Geographically, the state is divided into two parts: 
>* The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic (in the far north)
>* The Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests (that cover the majority of the state's interior). 
 
The smaller ecoregions are the Central African mangroves in the far south of the country's coast and a part of the montane Cameroonian Highlands forests in the far northeast. The Cross River, which bisects Cross-River State's interior before forming much of the state's western border and flowing into the Cross-River Estuary, is the state's most prominent geographical feature. The Calabar and Great Kwa rivers, which flow from the inland Oban Hills before flanking Calabar and flowing into the Cross-River Estuary, are also significant.
 In the forested interior of the state are several biodiverse protected areas including the 
Cross-River National Park, 
Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, and 
Mbe Mountains Community Forest. 

>The Cross-river forest possesses vast features of a typical tropical rainforest ecosystem. The area harbours some African threatened species that are of paramount conservation relevance. Some of these tree species included ***Terminalia ivorensis, Pterocarpus soyauxii, Melicia excelsa, Bailonella toxisperma and Afzelia bipindensis*** . Besides the tree species, the forest equally contains animals of conservation significance. Amongst these are the  wildlife populations of **Preuss's red colobus, African forest buffalo, bat hawk, tree pangolin, grey-necked rockfowl, and West African slender-snouted crocodile** along with some of Nigeria's last remaining **Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, drill, African forest elephant, and the Cross River gorilla** (Gorilla gorilla diehli) also endemic to the area.
The Forest resources of the state cover’s six ecological zones namely:- 
> 1.  Mangrove forests with an area of  480Km2 <br>
>2.  Swamp forest with an area of  520Km2 <br>
>3.  Tropical High Forests including the National Park with an area of  7,290 Km2 <br>
>4.  Plantations with an area of  460Km2 <br>
>5.  Other forests with an area of  216Km2 <br>
>6.  Other land uses have an area of 12,299 Km2 <br>            

Cross River State has lost approximately 19% of its tropical high forests over the last decades due to insufficient Forestry Department funding, population and immigration growth, and plantation establishment. <br>

Cross River State is rapidly developing its ecotourism potential and is widely regarded as Nigeria's premier tourist destination. The ability to balance, utilize, and preserve species, particularly those endemic to Cross River state, offers a solid foundation for environmental sustainability as well as significant money-making potential in the not-too-distant future.

**```Concerns:```** <br>
>Both divisions of the park are threatened by illegal logging, slash and burn farming and poaching. Eco-tourism may support efforts to preserve the park fauna. Assisting villagers in buffer zones to practice sustainable forestry also holds promise.
